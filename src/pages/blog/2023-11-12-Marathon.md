# Athens Marathon the Authentic

Today, we went to the Panathenaic Stadium to watch the 40th Athens Marathon. The atmosphere was fantastic, and the sun was shining🔆. It was especially cool as this is the original path from Marathon. What do you mean by this Tale, you may ask. Let's delve more into some history👩‍🌾🕵️‍♀️.

The marathon's origin is connected to the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC during the Greco-Persian Wars. After the Athenians defeated the Persians, a messenger named Pheidippides ran 42 kilometers from Marathon to Athens to deliver the news. Upon reaching Athens, he collapsed and died🪦 (maybe he did not do proper training before). This run inspired the modern marathon, first held in the modern Olympics in 1896.

The sharpest of you readers may know that the current marathon is 42.195 km (good job🤓). How did this happen, you may ask? During the 1908 London Olympics, the distance was changed to 42.195 so the race start and finish would be at Windsor Castle. This has been the standard distance ever since.

Hope you learned something new and enjoy the pictures.
