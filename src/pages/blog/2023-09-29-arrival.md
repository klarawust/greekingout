# Arrived in Athens!

Yesterday we flew from Dubrovnik to Athens and moved into our appartment. We had to walk around in the area for a while and the location blew us away! We live in a lovely, busy street with lots of caff√©es, bars, gyros-places and generally a young, interesting crowd. The appartment itself also lived up to the expectations. It is big, bright and cozy. Overall a great first impression! Here are some photos we took the first hours/days in Athens:
