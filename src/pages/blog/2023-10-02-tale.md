# Tale + Erasmus = ❤️

Tale arrived in Athens yesterday, so now the whole gang is finally togheter<3

We had our first Erasmus events, starting with Flunky Ball, which is essentially what we call "ølkubb" in Norway. Me and Klara got a little tipsy;) Later in the evening we went to "Meet your buddy", which was just a big gathering with all the Erasmus students and the greek buddies. Everyone was super nice, and we are looking forward to get to know them better.

Today we had oriantation day, where we got introduced to our university, Athens University of Economics and Business, and got som free beautiful merch :-P
Tonight we are going to "Greek Dinner", where we will eat some delicious greek food and get to know some more people.
Peace out<3
