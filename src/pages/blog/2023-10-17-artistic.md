# Art in Athens

In Athens you can find art everywhere you go. Often it is political and reflects social classes and economical issues. Sometimes it is just artists decorating the city, without any deeper meaning. I love walking around in the streets and observing small and big artworks. Norway feels clean and steril compared to Athens. There is something beautiful about it, but at the same time it can make you feel the trouble of the city more. Greece has been through som rough years with economical crises, fires and in the 70Â´s the police killed dozens of students in a school-shooting. This still affects the area we live in, Exarchia, a lot. The police are hated by most locals because they try to gentrify the area. Still, the local people are very friendly to the tourists and people like us that move here to study. I think that it shows how generous the greek people are. They are angry at the police and government for gentrifying the area and pushing the prices up and the local people out, but at the same time their anger does not direct towards tourists. I have never met a people that are generally so open, approachable and accepting. I am looking forward to get to experience the area even more, and get to know more greek people.
