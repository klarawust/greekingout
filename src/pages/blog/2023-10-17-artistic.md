# Art in Athens

In Athens you can find art everywhere you go. Often it is political and reflects social classes and economical issues. Sometimes it is just artists decorating the city, without any deeper meaning. I love walking around in the streets and observing small and big artworks. Norway feels clean and steril compared to Athens. There is something beautiful about it, but at the same time it can make you feel the trouble of the city more. Greece has been through som rough years with the longlasting economical crises and the recent fires. Also, an event that happened in the 70's still affects the politics of our area, Exarchia, a lot. The police killed 24 demonstrating students. For this reasen, the police are disliked by most locals. Also they take active measures to gentrify Exarchia. Still, the local people are very friendly to the tourists and people like us that move here to study. I think that it shows how generous the greek people are. They are angry at the police and government for gentrifying the area and pushing the prices up and the local people out, but at the same time their anger does not direct towards us foreigners. I have never met a people that are generally so open, approachable and accepting. I am looking forward to get to experience the area even more, and get to know more greek people.
