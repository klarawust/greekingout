# Traveling through Europe

Right now Aurora and me are traveling down to Athens. Our route goes like this:

Berlin - Freiburg - Innsbruck - Ljubljana - Novalja - Zadar - Hvar - Dubrovnik - Kotor - Athens

Our goal was to travel all the way from Berlin to Athens with busses and trains, but we had to give in after learning about the bad bus- and train-connections in southeast Europe (Albania and Greece).

We are enjoying our journey very much, but are also very excited to get to Athens!
